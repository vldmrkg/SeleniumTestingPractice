# pythonTestingSelenium

This project is a practical showcase of my skills in automated testing using Selenium WebDriver, Pytest, and Python. Following Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles and the Page Object Model (POM), it demonstrates my proficiency in testing web applications.

## Project Purpose

The main goal of this project is to demonstrate my acquired knowledge and expertise in automated testing. It serves as a practical exercise, highlighting best practices in Selenium and Python to test web applications effectively.


## Project Structure

The project structure comprises the following key components:

- **Locators:** Contains both locators and page classes that encapsulate the behavior of web pages, following the Page Object Model (POM).
- **Utilities:** Houses utility functions and the BaseClass for shared functionalities.
- **Tests:** Consists of test scripts written in Pytest, demonstrating end-to-end and unit tests.
- **TestData:** Holds fake data used for testing purposes.

## Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

The project leverages OOP principles to organize code into classes and objects, improving maintainability and reusability.

## Page Object Model (POM)

POM is implemented to abstract the UI components and actions on the pages. Each page has a corresponding class in the 'locators' module, encapsulating related functionalities.
